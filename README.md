# dfolio.github.io

This repository is to provide some pages to share some various things that I am interested in, and working on as personal hobbies.
Basically it is a cornerstone for most of my personal projects and anything I'm involed in.
This could become a replacement for my [current site](http://dfolio.free.fr) <http://dfolio.free.fr>.
